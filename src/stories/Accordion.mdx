Accordion

An Accordion component displays a vertically stacked list of headers that can be clicked to reveal or hide content.

Accordions are essential for creating FAQ sections, documentation sidebars, or any area where content density needs to be managed.

Default

This demonstrates the basic functionality where content slides open and only one item can be active at a time (single-open).

Anatomy & Logic

Examples

Themed

You can easily style the Accordion to fit your application's theme using utility classes, as shown in this Indigo-themed example.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Themed} />

Props

The provided Accordion structure is typically a composite component. The primary internal logic relies on:

title: The text displayed on the header button.

content: The collapsible text/HTML content.

value: A unique identifier for the item (used for state tracking).

openValue: The value of the currently open item (a string or null).

toggle: The function to update the openValue.
