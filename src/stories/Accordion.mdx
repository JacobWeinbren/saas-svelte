# Accordion

Used to show and hide sections of related content on a page.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} />

## Anatomy

The Accordion component is a composed component that handles accessibility (ARIA attributes), keyboard navigation, and animations automatically.

```tsx
// Anatomy Example
import { Accordion } from "$saas/accordion";

const items = [{ value: "item-1", title: "Trigger", text: "Content..." }];

<Accordion items={items} />;
```

Examples
Variants
Use the variant prop to change the visual style of the accordion. Values can be outline, subtle, enclosed, or plain.

Subtle <Canvas of={AccordionStories.Subtle} />

Enclosed <Canvas of={AccordionStories.Enclosed} />

Plain <Canvas of={AccordionStories.Plain} />

Sizes
Use the size prop to change the size of the accordion.

Small <Canvas of={AccordionStories.Small} />

Large <Canvas of={AccordionStories.Large} />

Expand Multiple Items
Use the multiple prop to allow multiple items to be expanded at once.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Multiple} />

With Icon
You can pass an icon property (a Svelte component, e.g., Lucide icons) inside your items array to add visual context.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.WithIcons} />

Disabled
Pass the disabled prop to disable the entire accordion, or set disabled: true on specific items in your data array.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Disabled} />
