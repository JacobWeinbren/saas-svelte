# Visually Hidden

## Used to hide content visually but keep it accessible to screen readers.

<Canvas of={VisuallyHiddenStories.Basic} />

## Usage

The `VisuallyHidden` component hides content from the visual UI while keeping it accessible to assistive technologies like screen readers. This is useful for providing context or labels that are needed for accessibility but would be redundant or unnecessary for sighted users.

```html
<script>
	import { VisuallyHidden } from "$saas/utilities/visually-hidden";
	import { Button } from "$saas/components/button";
</script>

<Button>
	<Bell />
	3
	<VisuallyHidden>Notifications</VisuallyHidden>
</Button>
```

## Examples

### With Input

Use `VisuallyHidden` to provide accessible labels for form inputs without displaying them visually.

<Canvas of={VisuallyHiddenStories.WithInput} />

### Skip Link

Create accessible skip navigation links that appear on focus.

<Canvas of={VisuallyHiddenStories.SkipLink} />

## Accessibility

The `VisuallyHidden` component uses CSS techniques to hide content from the visual viewport while ensuring it remains:

- Accessible to screen readers
- Included in the page's tab order (if it contains focusable elements)
- Available to other assistive technologies

This is achieved using:
- `position: absolute` to remove from normal flow
- `clip` and `clip-path` to hide visually
- Minimal dimensions (`1px x 1px`) to maintain accessibility

## Props

<ArgTypes {...getControls(["children", "class"])} />
